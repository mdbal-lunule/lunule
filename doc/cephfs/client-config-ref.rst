 Client Config Reference
========================

``client acl type``

:Description: Set the ACL type. Currently, only possible value is ``"posix_acl"`` to enable POSIX ACL, or an empty string. This option only takes effect when the ``fuse_default_permissions`` is set to ``false``.

:Type: String

:Description: Set client cache midpoint. The midpoint splits the least recently used lists into a hot and warm list.
:Type: Float
:Default: ``0.75``

``client_cache_size``

:Description: Set the number of inodes that the client keeps in the metadata cache.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``16384``

``client_caps_release_delay``

:Description: Set the delay between capability releases in seconds. The delay sets how many seconds a client waits to release capabilities that it no longer needs in case the capabilities are needed for another user space operation.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``5`` (seconds)

``client_debug_force_sync_read``

:Description: If set to ``true``, clients read data directly from OSDs instead of using a local page cache.

:Description: If set to ``true``, use the recursive size of a directory (that is, total of all descendants).
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``

``client_max_inline_size``

:Description: Set the maximum size of inlined data stored in a file inode rather than in a separate data object in RADOS. This setting only applies if the ``inline_data`` flag is set on the MDS map.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``4096``

``client_metadata``

:Description: Comma-delimited strings for client metadata sent to each MDS, in addition to the automatically generated version, host name, and other metadata.
:Type: String
:Default: ``""`` (no additional metadata)

``client_mount_gid``

:Description: Set the group ID of CephFS mount.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``-1``

``client_mount_timeout``

:Description: Set the timeout for CephFS mount in seconds.
:Type: Float
:Default: ``300.0``

``client_mount_uid``

:Description: Set the user ID of CephFS mount.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``-1``

``client_mountpoint``

:Description: Directory to mount on the CephFS file system. An alternative to the ``-r`` option of the ``ceph-fuse`` command.

:Description: Set the maximum number of dirty bytes in the object cache.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``104857600`` (100MB)

``client_oc_max_dirty_age``

:Description: Set the maximum age in seconds of dirty data in the object cache before writeback.
:Type: Float
:Default: ``5.0`` (seconds)

``client_oc_max_objects``

:Description: Set the maximum number of objects in the object cache.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``1000``

:Description: Set how many bytes of data will the client cache.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``209715200`` (200 MB)

``client_oc_target_dirty``

:Description: Set the target size of dirty data. We recommend to keep this number low.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``8388608`` (8MB)

``client_permissions``

:Description: Check client permissions on all I/O operations.
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``

``client_quota``

:Description: Enable client quota checking if set to ``true``.
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``

``client_quota_df``

:Description: Report root directory quota for the ``statfs`` operation.
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``

``client_readahead_max_bytes``

:Description: Set the maximum number of bytes that the kernel reads ahead for future read operations. Overridden by the ``client_readahead_max_periods`` setting.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``0`` (unlimited)

``client_readahead_max_periods``

:Description: Set the number of file layout periods (object size * number of stripes) that the kernel reads ahead. Overrides the ``client_readahead_max_bytes`` setting.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``4``

``client_use_random_mds``

:Description: Choose random MDS for each request.
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``false``

``fuse_default_permissions``

:Description: When set to ``false``, ``ceph-fuse`` utility checks does its own permissions checking, instead of relying on the permissions enforcement in FUSE. Set to ``false`` together with the ``client acl type=posix_acl`` option to enable POSIX ACL.
