 ceph-detect-init -- display the init system Ceph should use
============================================================

.. program:: ceph-detect-init

Synopsis
========

| **ceph-detect-init** [--verbose] [--use-rhceph] [--default *init*]

Description
===========

:program:`ceph-detect-init` is a utility that prints the init system
Ceph uses. It can be one of ``sysvinit``, ``upstart`` or ``systemd``.
The init system Ceph uses may not be the default init system of the
host operating system. For instance on Debian Jessie, Ceph may use
``sysvinit`` although ``systemd`` is the default.

If the init system of the host operating system is unknown, return on
error, unless :option:`--default` is specified.

Options
=======

.. option:: --use-rhceph

   When an operating system identifies itself as Red Hat, it is
   treated as if it was CentOS. With :option:`--use-rhceph` it is
   treated as RHEL instead.

.. option:: --default INIT

   If the init system of the host operating system is unkown, return
   the value of *INIT* instead of failing with an error.

.. option:: --verbose

   Display additional information for debugging.

Bugs
====

:program:`ceph-detect-init` is used by :program:`ceph-disk` to figure out the init system to manage the mount directory of an OSD. But only following combinations are fully tested:

- `upstart` on `Ubuntu 14.04`
- `systemd` on `Ubuntu 15.04` and up
- `systemd` on `Debian 8` and up
- `systemd` on `RHEL/CentOS 7` and up
- `systemd` on `Fedora 22` and up

Availability
============

:program:`ceph-detect-init` is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to
the Ceph documentation at http://ceph.com/docs for more information.
