Description
===========

:program:`ceph-disk` is a utility that can prepare and activate a disk, partition or
directory as a Ceph OSD. It is run directly or triggered by :program:`ceph-deploy`
or ``udev``. It can also be triggered by other deployment utilities like ``Chef``,
``Juju``, ``Puppet`` etc.

It actually automates the multiple steps involved in manual creation and start
of an OSD into two steps of preparing and activating the OSD by using the
subcommands ``prepare`` and ``activate``.

:program:`ceph-disk` also automates the multiple steps involved to manually stop
and destroy an OSD into two steps of deactivating and destroying the OSD by using
the subcommands ``deactivate`` and ``destroy``.

The documentation for each subcommand (prepare, activate, etc.) can be displayed
with its ``--help`` option. For instance ``ceph-disk prepare --help``.
