=============================
 Block Devices and CloudStack
=============================

You may use Ceph Block Device images with CloudStack 4.0 and higher through
``libvirt``, which configures the QEMU interface to ``librbd``. Ceph stripes
block device images as objects across the cluster, which means that large Ceph
Block Device images have better performance than a standalone server!

To use Ceph Block Devices with CloudStack 4.0 and higher, you must install QEMU,
``libvirt``, and CloudStack first. We recommend using a separate physical host
for your CloudStack installation. CloudStack recommends a minimum of 4GB of RAM
and a dual-core processor, but more CPU and RAM will perform better. The
following diagram depicts the CloudStack/Ceph technology stack.

.. important:: To use Ceph Block Devices with CloudStack, you must have  
   access to a running Ceph Storage Cluster.

CloudStack integrates with Ceph's block devices to provide CloudStack with a
back end for CloudStack's Primary Storage. The instructions below detail the
setup for CloudStack Primary Storage.

.. note:: We recommend installing with Ubuntu 14.04 or later so that 
   you can use package installation instead of having to compile 
   libvirt from source.

Installing and configuring QEMU for use with CloudStack doesn't require any
special handling. Ensure that you have a running Ceph Storage Cluster. Install
QEMU and configure it for use with Ceph; then, install ``libvirt`` version
0.9.13 or higher (you may need to compile from source) and ensure it is running
with Ceph.


.. note:: Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS 7.2 will have ``libvirt`` with RBD storage
   pool support enabled by default.

.. index:: pools; CloudStack

Create a Pool
=============

By default, Ceph block devices use the ``rbd`` pool. Create a pool for
CloudStack NFS Primary Storage. Ensure your Ceph cluster is running, then create
the pool. ::

   ceph osd pool create cloudstack
   
See `Create a Pool`_ for details on specifying the number of placement groups
for your pools, and `Placement Groups`_ for details on the number of placement
groups you should set for your pools.

A newly created pool must initialized prior to use. Use the ``rbd`` tool
to initialize the pool::

        rbd pool init cloudstack

Create a Ceph User
==================

To access the Ceph cluster we require a Ceph user which has the correct
credentials to access the ``cloudstack`` pool we just created. Although we could
use ``client.admin`` for this, it's recommended to create a user with only
access to the ``cloudstack`` pool. ::

  ceph auth get-or-create client.cloudstack mon 'profile rbd' osd 'profile rbd pool=cloudstack'

Use the information returned by the command in the next step when adding the 
Primary Storage.

See `User Management`_ for additional details.

Add Primary Storage
===================

To add primary storage, refer to `Add Primary Storage (4.2.0)`_ to add a Ceph block device, the steps
include: 

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI.
#. Click **Infrastructure** on the left side navigation bar. 
#. Select the Zone you want to use for Primary Storage.
#. Click the **Compute** tab.
#. Select **View All** on the `Primary Storage` node in the diagram.
#. Click **Add Primary Storage**.
#. Follow the CloudStack instructions.

   - For **Protocol**, select ``RBD``.
   - Add cluster information (cephx is supported). Note: Do not include the ``client.`` part of the user.
   - Add ``rbd`` as a tag.


Create a Disk Offering
======================

To create a new disk offering, refer to `Create a New Disk Offering (4.2.0)`_.
Create a disk offering so that it matches the ``rbd`` tag.
The ``StoragePoolAllocator`` will choose the  ``rbd``
pool when searching for a suitable storage pool. If the disk offering doesn't
match the ``rbd`` tag, the ``StoragePoolAllocator`` may select the pool you
created (e.g., ``cloudstack``).


Limitations
===========

- CloudStack will only bind to one monitor (You can however create a Round Robin DNS record over multiple monitors)
