clusters/    - some predefined cluster layouts
suites/      - set suite

The suites directory has a hierarchical collection of tests.  This can be
freeform, but generally follows the convention of

  suites/<test suite name>/<test group>/...

A test is described by a yaml fragment.

A test can exist as a single .yaml file in the directory tree.  For example:

 suites/foo/one.yaml
 suites/foo/two.yaml

is a simple group of two tests.

A directory with a magic '+' file represents a test that combines all
other items in the directory into a single yaml fragment.  For example:

 suites/foo/bar/+
 suites/foo/bar/a.yaml
 suites/foo/bar/b.yaml
 suites/foo/bar/c.yaml

is a single test consisting of a + b + c.

A directory with a magic '%' file represents a test matrix formed from
all other items in the directory.  For example,

 suites/baz/%
 suites/baz/a.yaml
 suites/baz/b/b1.yaml
 suites/baz/b/b2.yaml
 suites/baz/c.yaml
 suites/baz/d/d1.yaml
 suites/baz/d/d2.yaml

is a 4-dimensional test matrix.  Two dimensions (a, c) are trivial (1
item), so this is really 2x2 = 4 tests, which are

  a + b1 + c + d1
  a + b1 + c + d2
  a + b2 + c + d1
  a + b2 + c + d2

Symlinks are okay.
